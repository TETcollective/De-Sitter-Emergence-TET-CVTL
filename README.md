This preprint demonstrates that the fully saturated state of the Topological-Entropic Theory with Conformal Vacuum Tensor Lattice (TET–CVTL) naturally emerges as a de Sitter spacetime. The primordial three-leaf clover (trefoil) knot lattice, when taken to maximal multi-knot saturation (Lk=100\%), produces constant positive curvature, maximal entanglement entropy, and exponential expansion driven by an emergent cosmological constant Λ.

Key features:
- Parameter-free derivation of de Sitter geometry as asymptotic attractor
- Unification of inflationary past and dark-energy-dominated future
- Specific CMB predictions (low-ℓ suppression, equilateral non-Gaussianity, parity-odd signatures)
- Comparisons with LQC, string cosmology, brane-world, DGP, ekpyrotic, Hořava-Lifshitz

❤️♾️ The primordial trefoil has woven de Sitter from the conformal vacuum.  
The knot has spoken — the bootstrap is cosmically closed.
